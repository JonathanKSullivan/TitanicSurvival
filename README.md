# TitanicSurvival
Created decision functions that attempt to predict survival outcomes from the 1912 Titanic disaster based on each passengerâ€™s features, such as sex and age.
## Purpose:
In this project I created a decision functions that attempt to predict survival outcomes from the 912 Titaninc disaster based on each passenger's features, such as sex and age. I started with a simple algorithm and increased its complexity until you are able to accurately predict the outcome for at least 80%of the passengers in the provided data.
## How to use:
The project has 4 files:
* Titanic_Survival_Exploration.html: Final Report
* titanic_survival_exploration.ipynb: This is the main file where my work was performed the project.
* titanic_data.csv: The project dataset.
* visuals.py: This Python script contains helper functions that create the necessary visualizations.
### To view results 
Open up a browser window or tab. Click file then open. Navigate to the folder containing the project files and double click Titanic_Survival_Exploration.html .
### To interact with ipynb file
In the Terminal or Command Prompt, navigate to the folder containing the project files, and then use the command jupyter notebook titanic_survival_exploration.ipynb to open up a browser window or tab to work with your notebook.
